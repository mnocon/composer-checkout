# Composer Checkout Plugin

## Description
This Composer plugin allows you to add a Pull Request from GitHub as a Composer dependency without thinking about repositories and branch aliases.
Forget about meddling with the `vendor` directory as well ;)

Simply run `composer checkout <pullRequestUrl> [<pullRequestUrl2>...]` and the rest will be taken care of automatically.

![Example usage of the command](example.png "Example usage")

There is also a `apply-patch` command that deals with diffs generated from Pull Requests.

## Installation

It's recommended to do the global installation:
`composer global require mnocon/composer-checkout`
which will make the new commands available in each project.

For a local install run:
`composer require mnocon/composer-checkout`

This packages requires at least PHP 7.1 and Composer 2.

## Usage

There are two new Composer commands:

### `composer checkout`

Adds a Composer dependency based on GitHub Pull Request.

Example usage:
```
composer checkout https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/41105
```

or interactively:
```
 composer checkout

 > 1

 Link to Pull Request:
 > https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/41105
```

In both cases the output will be similar to this one:
```
